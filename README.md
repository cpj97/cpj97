I am Camilo Pedraza Jiménez, a Colombian Economist and Political Scientist currently studying a Master's in Data Science at [Hertie School](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/), where I also got a Master's in Public Policy.

🤓 During my studies, I've developed interest in quantitative methods, specially in statistics and causal inference 📈. More recently, I have got more in depth knowledge on data science techniques, such as applied machine learning, natural language processing and geospatial analysis 🌏. I, this regard, I use such skills to address public policy issues and look for solutions that contribute to a sustainable development 🌱.

**Also, I combine my career with my current passion for bouldering**🧗
